# Abstract
Today, Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) has become a standard memory element of any Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), System-On-Chips (SoC), because they are fast, robust, nearly universally found on the same die with microcontrollers and microprocessors. This paper presents detailed implementation of 32 bit SRAM using eSim and SKY130 PDK. SRAM is much faster than DRAM (Dynamic RAM), so to utilize SRAM to the fullest we have the concept of caching the memory i.e we save the data in SRAMs on first load so that in the consecutive load time reduces drastically. SRAM can retain its stored information as long as power is supplied. The term random access means that in an array of SRAM cells each cell can be read or written in any order, no matter which cell was last accessed. SRAMs are majorly used in server based web applications because the servers are usually switched on all the time. 

# Building blocks for 32 bit SRAM: 

The components required for building 32 Bit SRAM cell are:
1. 5x32 SRAM Address Decoder and 3x8 SRAM Address Decoder implemented in digital domain using NgVeri feature in eSim. 
2. 1-bit SRAM cell as shown in fig 2 which further consists of
3. Data writer circuit implemented in digital domain using NgVeri
4. 6T SRAM cell and 
5. Sense amplifier circuit implemented in analog domain using eSim. 

The project is about building a 32-bit SRAM memory array, using 130nm CMOS technology and modular design approach. The functional block diagram of 32 bit SRAM is shown in fig 1. Using sub-circuit feature in eSim, interconnection of the Decoder and the 1-Bit SRAMs will be implemented to create the 8-Bit SRAM and then create another sub circuit symbol for four such 8 bit SRAM to interconnect 5x32 address decoder and 32 bit SRAM.

Fig 2. 1 bit SRAM Cell implementation

1 bit RAM cell consists of data writer circuit, 6T RAM cell, pre-charge circuit and a sense amplifier all implemented in analog domain using eSim as shown in Fig 2. First, a 8 bit SRAM cell is build using eight 1 Bit SRAM. They are accessed by 3 bit address using a 3x8 decoder which is implemented in digital domain as shown in fig 3. 

# 3x8 SRAM Address Decoder 
Decoder is a digital circuit which is used to change a given code into a set of signals. Here we are using a Decoder to select one out of eight 1-bit SRAM cells to perform the read/write operations.

The 3x8 SRAM Address Decoder is be used to select the 8-bit SRAM cell to which we want to perform the read/write operation.

<p align="center">
Fig 3. 3x8 SRAM Address Decoder
</p>

As shown above in fig 3, a 3X8 decoder has 4 inputs and 8 outputs. The first three inputs a0, a1, a2 are used to give the coded signal and the fourth signal enbl acts as an enable. If the enbl signal is low then all the ouputs d0 to d7 will remain low.

In this design, the above decoder has been implemented using the MakerChip feature in eSim . After opening the eSim v2.3, open the MakerChip tab present on the left side and load the file with the Verilog code. We can verify the functionality of the loaded verilog code using the MakerChip EDA tool integrated with the eSim tool. Then we can switch over to the NgVeri tab and use it to convert the verilog code into NgSpice netlist. The verilog code for the above decoder is as follows:

```
module isramsd_decoder(d,a,enbl);
//this is verilog code for 3x8 SRAM address decoder 
input [2:0]a;
input enbl;
output reg [7:0]d;
always @(a) 
  begin
    if(enbl==1)
      begin
        d[0] = !a[0] & !a[1] & !a[2];
        d[1] = a[0] & !a[1] & !a[2];
        d[2] = !a[0] & a[1] & !a[2];
        d[3] = a[0] & a[1] & !a[2];
        d[4] = !a[0] & !a[1] & a[2];
        d[5] = a[0] & !a[1] & a[2];
        d[6] = !a[0] & a[1] & a[2];
        d[7] = a[0] & a[1] & a[2];
      end
    else d = 8'b00000000;

As shown above in fig 5, a 5x32 decoder has 6 inputs and 32 outputs. The first five inputs a0, a1, a2, a3 and a4 are used to give the coded signal and the sixth signal enbl acts as an enable. If the enbl signal is low then all the ouputs d0 to d31 will remain low.

The truth table for the 5X32 Decoder is as follows:

# 6T SRAM Cell: 
The structure of a 6 transistor SRAM cell, storing one bit of information, can be seen in fig 8. The core of the cell is formed by two CMOS inverters. This feedback loop stabilizes the inverters to their respective state. The access transistors Mn3 & Mn4 the word and bit lines, wl and bl, are used to read and write from or to the cell. There are 3 inputs to the 6T RAM cell which are Write line(wl), Bit line(bl) and Bit line bar(blbar). When the wl is high the N-MOSFETs on either sides of the latched inverters are switched on so that the value in the bl, blb are transferred to opposite sides of the inverter network overriding the already present value.

# Data Writer circuit: 
In read operation, the bit-lines are pre-charged to Vdd, so if a write operation occurs, one of the bit-lines should driven back to low logic before enabling access transistors. Write drivers are used for this purpose. This circuit provides the input to the 6T SRAM cell. The funtionality of this block is to provide bl and blbar to the SRAM cell, when the inputs wl and win are high the bl and blbar will also be high else both the outputs will be low. For this design the Writer Circuit has been designed using the NgVeri feature of the eSim. 
The Verilog code is as follows:

```
module idata_writer_cktsd(bl,blbar,wl,win);
  input wl,win;
  output reg bl,blbar;
  always @(wl,win) begin
    bl = wl & win;
    blbar = !bl;
  end
endmodule
```

# Sense amplifier circuit: 
This circuit is used to read the data present in the SRAM cell. It has an Read Enable(r_en) pin which when high gives the value present in the SRAM cell as output. Pre-charge circuit is used to pre-charge the bit-lines to Vdd or high logic during a read operation. The function of sense amplifier is to amplify the very small analog differential voltage between the bit-lines during a read operation and provide a digital output.

This approach of using sub-circuit to create a circuit schematic is known as 'Modular design approach' i.e breaking bigger circuit into smaller parts.

## 32-Bit SRAM cell circuit simulation:
After making the schematic and generating the netlist of 32 bit SRAM circuit schematic, similar steps are carried out to simulate the 32 bit SRAM circuit and get the desired output as shown below:

As seen, from the waveforms of 32 bit SRAM cell, less than half the outputs are visible in simulation window. This arrangment is donw due to limitation of numbers of plots visbile in one screen.

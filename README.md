# Abstract
Today, Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) has become a standard memory element of any Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), System-On-Chips (SoC), because they are fast, robust, nearly universally found on the same die with microcontrollers and microprocessors. This paper presents detailed implementation of 32 bit SRAM using eSim and SKY130 PDK. SRAM is much faster than DRAM (Dynamic RAM), so to utilize SRAM to the fullest we have the concept of caching the memory i.e we save the data in SRAMs on first load so that in the consecutive load time reduces drastically. SRAM can retain its stored information as long as power is supplied. The term random access means that in an array of SRAM cells each cell can be read or written in any order, no matter which cell was last accessed. SRAMs are majorly used in server based web applications because the servers are usually switched on all the time. 

# Reference Circuit Diagram
The structure of a 6 transistor SRAM cell, storing one bit of information, can be seen in Fig 1. The core of the cell is formed by two CMOS inverters. This feedback loop stabilizes the inverters to their respective state. The access transistors Mn3 & Mn4 the word and bit lines, wl and bl, are used to read and write from or to the cell. The project is about building a 32-bit SRAM memory array, using 130nm CMOS technology and modular design approach. First, a 8 bit SRAM cell is build using eight 1 Bit SRAM. They are accessed by 3 bit address using a 3x8 decoder which is implemented in digital domain as shown in Fig 2.

The 3x8 decoder will be used to select the 1-bit RAM cell to which we want to perform the read/write operation. Pre-charge circuit is used to pre-charge the bit-lines to Vdd or high logic during a read operation. The function of sense amplifier is to amplify the very small analog differential voltage between the bit-lines during a read operation and provide a digital output. In read operation, the bit-lines are pre-charged to Vdd during the read operation, so if a write operation occurs, one of the bit-lines should driven back to low logic before enabling access transistors. Write drivers are used for this purpose.

Digital block will be implemented in Verilog, whereas analog block will be implemented in eSim as shown in Fig 4. After creation of the all the symbols using sub-circuit feature, interconnection of the Decoder and the 1-Bit SRAMs will be carried out as shown in the schematic to create the 8-Bit SRAM and then create another sub circuit symbol to interconnect address decoder and 32 bit SRAM.

# Circuit diagram in eSim 

The following is the first version of schematic in eSim is shown in fig 5
It consists of 8 bit PRS generator, digital sine wave LUT generator, 10 bit DAC used as 8 bit DAC and 2nd order sallen key low pass filter tuned at 1KHz.

First attempt was unsecuccesful, so in 2nd attempt 2nd order sallen key Low pass filter was replaced by RLC circuit tuned at 1KHz frequency as shown in fig 6

# PRS generator block 
PRS generator block shown in fig 8, generates a finite stream of numbers in range 1 to 255 equally distributed. In addition we add a compare function, which turns one digital output pin high whenever a value in the shift register (SR) is less the value of the compare input. This will create a stream of high pulses proportional to the compare value.

## Makerchip plots
Makerchip output plots for PRS generator block are shown in fig 9. As the sift register value range is between 1 to 255 means if compare value is  11111111, the output will be always 1. If the compare value is 0, the output will always be 0. Fig 9 shows the compressed version of the PRS generator block waveforms for compare value 11111110 which shows one low pulse in a periodic stream after 255 clock pulses with 8 bit PRS period (i.e 2^n-1, where n = 8)
